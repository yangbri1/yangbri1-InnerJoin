/**
 * SQL sublanguage: DQL (Data Query Language)
 *
 * Sometimes we want to query results from multiple tables. We can achieve this by doing a JOIN to include data from other
 * tables. We start with SELECT FROM left_table, and we can JOIN right_table.
 *
 * There are several types of joins. We will be looking at INNER JOIN here. INNER JOIN is when we query two or more
 * tables on some criteria, and only see results where there are matching rows in all tables.
 *
 * Example: SELECT * FROM table_left INNER JOIN table_right
 * ON table_left.column1 = table_right.column3;
 *
 * You can add more functionality to this SQL query, for instance, you can also filter within this query.
 *
 * Example: SELECT * FROM table_left INNER JOIN table_right
 * ON table_left.column1 = table_right.column3
 * WHERE table_left.column1 = value;
 *
 * Note: The text added to a simple select statement includes INNER, JOIN, and ON keywords. We join one table to another
 * based on some condition that matches rows from both tables together. In the above example we are matching rows
 * from table_left which have the same value in column 1 as those in table_right column 3.
 *
 * Consider the following tables:
 *
 *              class                                  student
 * | id  |  teacher_name |class_title|    | id   |    student_name  |class_title|
 *  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * |1   |'Ms. Lovelace' |'Physics'  |     |1   |'John Stewart'     |'Writing'  |
 * |2   |'Ms. Lovelace' |'Math'     |     |2   |'Stephen Colbert'  |'Physics'  |
 * |3   |'Mr. McCarthy' |'Writing'  |     |3   |'Samantha Bee'     |'Math'     |
 * |4   |'Ms. Goodall'  |'Biology'  |     |4   |'Aasif Mandvi'     |'Writing'  |
 *                                        |5   |'Robert Riggle'    |'Physics'  |
 *                                        |6   |'Jessica Williams' |'Art'      |
 *
 * We can query these tables with an INNER JOIN ON the "class" column in each table:
 *      SELECT * FROM class
 *      INNER JOIN student ON class.class_title = students.class_title;
 *
 *  The output of the join would create the following result set.
 *              class                                  student
 * | id     |  teacher_name |class_title  | id    |      student_name  |class_title|
 *  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  |1     |'Ms. Lovelace'   |'Physics'   |2     |'Stephen Colbert'    |'Physics' |
 *  |1     |'Ms. Lovelace'   |'Physics'   |5     |'Robert Riggle'      |'Physics' |
 *  |2     |'Ms. Lovelace'   |'Math'      |3     |'Samantha Bee'       |'Math'    |
 *  |3     |'Mr. McCarthy'   |'Writing'   |1     |'John Stewart'       |'Writing' |
 *  |3     |'Mr. McCarthy'   |'Writing'   |4     |'Aasif Mandvi'       |'Writing' |
 *
 * NOTE: Both teacher Ms. Goodall and student Jessica Williams would not be included in the
 * results. This is because there is no matching record in the opposite table for either of those records. (There is
 * no art teacher, and there are no students taking biology.)
